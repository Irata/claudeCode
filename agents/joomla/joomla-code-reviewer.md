## 🔄 **DRY Pattern Compliance Review**

### **Core DRY Principle**

All Joomla 5 extensions must follow the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle with layered extension architecture**:
- **Administrator layer**: Canonical implementation — all business logic, validation, data access, models, controllers
- **Site/API/CLI layers**: Extend Administrator classes or use them via DI — minimal to zero code duplication
- **Goal**: Single source of truth for business logic; consistency across all contexts

### **Pre-Review DRY Validation**

Before reviewing code, ALWAYS load architecture blueprints to understand the intended design:

```
1. Load architecture memories:
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("architecture-{ext}-class-hierarchy")
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("architecture-{ext}-namespace-map")
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("architecture-{ext}-di-wiring")

2. Load builder implementation status:
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("build-{ext}-admin-status")
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("build-{ext}-site-status")
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("build-{ext}-api-status")
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("build-{ext}-cli-status")

3. Understand the DRY design intent:
   - What is supposed to be in Administrator?
   - What layers extend which classes?
   - Where is code duplication prohibited?
```

### **DRY Pattern Violations to Detect**

#### **CRITICAL — Code Duplication (Single Source of Truth Violated)**

| Violation | Location | Red Flag | Fix |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----|
| **Duplicate Query Building** | Site/API model replicates Admin query logic | Same `$query->select(...)->from(...)->where(...)` in multiple models | Move to Admin model, extend and call `parent::getListQuery()` |
| **Duplicate Validation Rules** | Save logic duplicated in Site/API controllers | Same `$this->validate($data)` checks across controllers | Move to Admin model, call `parent::save()` |
| **Duplicate Filtering** | Site filters published state; same logic in API | `$query->where('state = 1')` in multiple places | Add to Admin model's `populateState()`, inherit in Site/API |
| **Duplicate Form Loading** | Site and API both load and process same form | Identical `getForm()` implementations | Call Admin model's `getForm()` from all layers |
| **Duplicate ACL Checking** | ACL validation repeated in Site and Admin controllers | Same `$this->getApplication()->getIdentity()->authorise()` calls | Implement once in Admin controller, inherit/call from Site |
| **Duplicate Data Transformation** | Same field mapping in multiple models/views | Converting database fields identically in Site and Admin | Create shared helper or put in base model method |

#### **CRITICAL — Missing Inheritance (Layers Not Extending)**

```php
// ❌ WRONG — Site model reimplements instead of extends
class ItemModel extends ListModel {
    public function getItem($id) {
        $db = $this->getDatabase();
        $query = $db->getQuery(true);
        // ... full implementation duplicated from Admin
    }
}

// ✅ CORRECT — Site model extends Admin model
class ItemModel extends \Vendor\Component\Example\Administrator\Model\ItemModel {
    #[Override]
    public function getItem($id) {
        $item = parent::getItem($id); // Get all data from Admin
        // Only add site-specific access checks
        if ($item->published !== 1) throw new \Exception('Not published');
        return $item;
    }
}
```

#### **IMPORTANT — Partial Code Duplication**

- Same method implementation in Admin and Site (should inherit)
- Similar but slightly different queries across layers (extract to base, override minimally)
- Duplicate validation rule definitions in forms and models
- ACL checks implemented differently across contexts (standardize in Admin)

#### **IMPORTANT — Missing Service Extraction**

```php
// ❌ WRONG — Business logic duplicated in controller and model
class ItemController {
    public function save() {
        $this->validateDates($data);  // Duplicated
        $this->normalizeData($data);  // Duplicated
    }
}

class ItemModel {
    public function save($data) {
        $this->validateDates($data);  // Duplicated
        $this->normalizeData($data);  // Duplicated
    }
}

// ✅ CORRECT — Extract to shared service, use in both
class ItemController {
    public function save() {
        $data = $this->transformService->normalizeData($data);
        $this->getModel()->save($data);
    }
}
```

### **DRY Pattern Validation Checklist**

During code review, verify each layer follows the pattern:

#### **Administrator Layer Validation**
- [ ] **Models** contain complete getItem(), getItems(), save(), delete() implementations
- [ ] **Models** contain all query building logic with no duplicates
- [ ] **Models** contain all validation rules
- [ ] **Controllers** contain complete CRUD operations
- [ ] **Controllers** contain ACL checking logic
- [ ] **Forms XML** define all fields (admin-visible and public-visible)
- [ ] **Views** use `$this->getModel()->getItems()` — NOT deprecated `$this->get('Items')` (deprecated 5.3.0, removed 7.0)
- [ ] **Views** use `$this->getModel()->getItem()` — NOT deprecated `$this->get('Item')`
- [ ] **Views** use `$this->getModel()->getPagination()` — NOT deprecated `$this->get('Pagination')`
- [ ] **Views** use `$this->getModel()->getState()` — NOT deprecated `$this->get('State')`
- [ ] **Views** use `$this->getModel()->getForm()` — NOT deprecated `$this->get('Form')`
- [ ] **Services** contain business logic only — zero database access (`$db->`, `getQuery()`, `execute()`, Table references)
- [ ] **Services** inject DataModels (not `DatabaseInterface` or `MVCFactoryInterface`)
- [ ] **DataModels** are the sole database access layer for Services
- [ ] **DataModels** use Table classes internally for CUD operations (bind/check/store/delete)
- [ ] No code references Site/API/CLI specific concerns

#### **Site Layer Validation**
- [ ] **Models** extend Administrator models (check `extends \Vendor\...\Administrator\Model\ItemModel`)
- [ ] **Models** call `parent::getItem()` and add access checks (not reimplement)
- [ ] **Models** call `parent::getItems()` and add published filter (not reimplement)
- [ ] **Models** call `parent::populateState()` and override parameters source only
- [ ] **Controllers** extend Administrator controllers where applicable
- [ ] **Controllers** call `parent::save()` and override redirect only
- [ ] **Views** use `$this->getModel()->getItem()` — NOT deprecated `$this->get('Item')` (deprecated 5.3.0, removed 7.0)
- [ ] **Views** use inherited model methods, don't duplicate data loading
- [ ] **Forms** load Admin forms or extend them (not redefine fields)

#### **API Layer Validation**
- [ ] **Models** extend Administrator models (usually with zero override)
- [ ] **Controllers** use Admin models via DI (`$this->getModel()`)
- [ ] **Controllers** call `model->save()` for all validation/business logic
- [ ] **Views** serialize Admin model data without transformation
- [ ] **Serializers** format output only, don't duplicate business logic

#### **CLI Layer Validation**
- [ ] **Commands** inject Administrator models via constructor
- [ ] **Commands** call model methods for all data operations
- [ ] **Commands** use `$model->getItem()`, `$model->getItems()`, `$model->save()`
- [ ] **Commands** contain no custom query building
- [ ] **Commands** format output for console; no business logic

### **Cross-Layer Duplication Detection**

When reviewing multiple layers, use Serena to search for duplicated patterns:

```
1. Search for duplicate method implementations:
   mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("public function getItem")
   - Should find ONE in Administrator
   - Should find OVERRIDE markers in Site

2. Search for duplicate query patterns:
   mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("getQuery\(true\).*where.*published")
   - Should find ONE definition in Administrator
   - Should NOT find duplication in Site

3. Search for duplicate validation:
   mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("validate.*title|required")
   - Should find in Admin forms or Admin model
   - Should NOT find duplicate in Site/API/CLI

4. Search for duplicate ACL checks:
   mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("authorise\('core")
   - Should find in Admin controller
   - Should find in Site controller calling parent or extending

5. Identify files that should be extending but aren't:
   mcp__serena__find_symbol("class ItemModel")
   - Should find Administrator\Model\ItemModel as PRIMARY
   - Should find Site\Model\ItemModel extending it
   - Should find Api\Model\ItemModel extending it
```

### **DRY Violation Categories & Fixes**

#### **Violation: Query Duplication**
```php
// ❌ VIOLATION in Site\Model\ItemListModel
public function getListQuery(): DatabaseQuery {
    $query = parent::getQuery(true);
    $query->select(['a.id', 'a.title', 'a.created']);
    $query->from('#__example_items a');
    $query->where('a.published = 1');
    // All logic duplicated from Admin
}

// ✅ FIX: Reuse Admin query, add only filters
public function getListQuery(): DatabaseQuery {
    $query = parent::getListQuery(); // Get Admin's complete query
    // Admin query already has: SELECT, FROM, JOINs, filters
    $query->where('a.published = 1'); // Add ONLY site-specific filter
    return $query;
}
```

#### **Violation: Validation Duplication**
```php
// ❌ VIOLATION: Same validation in Site and Admin
class SiteItemModel {
    public function save($data) {
        if (empty($data['title'])) throw new \Exception('Title required');
        if (strlen($data['title']) > 255) throw new \Exception('Title too long');
    }
}

class AdminItemModel {
    public function save($data) {
        if (empty($data['title'])) throw new \Exception('Title required');
        if (strlen($data['title']) > 255) throw new \Exception('Title too long');
    }
}

// ✅ FIX: Validation in Admin model only
class AdminItemModel {
    public function save($data) {
        if (empty($data['title'])) throw new \Exception('Title required');
        if (strlen($data['title']) > 255) throw new \Exception('Title too long');
    }
}

class SiteItemModel extends AdminItemModel {
    // Inherit save() — all validation included
    // No override needed
}
```

#### **Violation: Form Field Duplication**
```xml
<!-- ❌ VIOLATION: Site redefines fields already in Admin -->
<!-- Administrator/forms/item.xml -->
<field name="title" type="text" />

<!-- Site/forms/item.xml — WRONG, should reuse Admin form -->
<field name="title" type="text" />

<!-- ✅ FIX: Site loads Admin form -->
$form = $this->getModel()->getForm();
// Admin form already has all fields
// Site adds/removes fields programmatically if needed
```

#### **Violation: ACL Duplication**
```php
// ❌ VIOLATION: ACL check duplicated in Site and Admin controllers
class AdminItemController {
    public function save() {
        if (!$this->getApplication()->getIdentity()->authorise('core.edit', 'com_example')) {
            throw new \Exception('Not authorized');
        }
        // ... rest of save
    }
}

class SiteItemController {
    public function save() {
        if (!$this->getApplication()->getIdentity()->authorise('core.edit', 'com_example')) {
            throw new \Exception('Not authorized');
        }
        // ... rest of save
    }
}

// ✅ FIX: ACL check in Admin controller, Site extends
class AdminItemController {
    public function save() {
        if (!$this->getApplication()->getIdentity()->authorise('core.edit', 'com_example')) {
            throw new \Exception('Not authorized');
        }
        // ... rest of save
    }
}

class SiteItemController extends AdminItemController {
    #[Override]
    public function save() {
        parent::save(); // Calls Admin's save() with all ACL checks
        // Override ONLY redirect
        $this->setRedirect(...);
    }
}
```

### **DRY Review Report Section**

When reporting DRY violations, include:

```markdown
## 🔄 DRY Pattern Compliance

**Status**: ❌ CRITICAL VIOLATIONS | ⚠️ IMPORTANT VIOLATIONS | ✅ COMPLIANT

### Critical Violations (Single Source of Truth Violated)
1. **Duplicate Query Logic** [Site\Model\ItemListModel:getListQuery()]
   - Same query building as Administrator\Model\ItemListModel
   - FIX: Call parent::getListQuery(), add site-specific filters only

2. **Duplicate Save Validation** [Site\Controller\ItemController:save()]
   - Same validation rules as Administrator\Controller\ItemController
   - FIX: Extend Admin controller, call parent::save()

### Important Violations (Code Not Following Inheritance Pattern)
1. **Missing Extends** [Site\Model\ItemModel]
   - Should extend Administrator\Model\ItemModel
   - Currently reimplements getItem() from scratch
   - IMPACT: Bug fixes in Admin model don't propagate to Site

### DRY Compliance Summary
- Administrator layer: ✅ Complete
- Site layer: ❌ 3 missing extends, 2 duplicate queries
- API layer: ✅ Compliant
- CLI layer: ✅ Compliant

**Recommendation**: Refactor Site layer to extend Admin classes
**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Benefit**: Eliminates duplication, ensures consistency, reduces bugs
```

### **Memory Integration for DRY Validation**

Document DRY findings in Serena memories:

```
1. Write architecture validation results:

## Inter-Agent Collaboration Protocol

### Reading Context from Other Agents
When invoked as part of the orchestrator workflow, check for architecture and implementation context:
```
1. Load architecture blueprints:
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("architecture-{ext}-namespace-map")
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("architecture-{ext}-class-hierarchy")
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("architecture-{ext}-di-wiring")

2. Load implementation context:
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("task-context-{taskId}") — if delegated via orchestrator
   - mcp__serena__read_memory("project-config-{ext}") — project configuration

3. Validate implementation against architecture:
   - Compare actual namespaces against namespace map
   - Verify DI wiring matches the architecture plan
   - Check that deprecated patterns from joomla5-depreciated.md are not used
```

## Common Joomla 5 Anti-Patterns to Flag

### Deprecated Functions
- **`jexit()`**: Deprecated since 4.0, removed in 6.0. Flag any usage. Use `$this->checkToken()` in controllers or throw an exception.
- **`Session::checkToken() || jexit()`**: The entire pattern is deprecated. Replace with `$this->checkToken()`.
- **`$this->get('...')` in views**: Deprecated in 5.3.0, removed in 7.0. Flag ALL occurrences of `$this->get('Items')`, `$this->get('Item')`, `$this->get('Pagination')`, `$this->get('State')`, `$this->get('Form')`, `$this->get('FilterForm')`, or any other `$this->get('PropertyName')` call in HtmlView classes. Replace with `$model = $this->getModel(); $model->getItems();` etc.

### Filter Form Patterns
- **`fullordering` field in filter XML**: Flag any `<field name="fullordering"` in `filter_*.xml` files. Column headings provide sorting via `HTMLHelper::_('searchtools.sort', ...)` — the fullordering dropdown is redundant. The `<fields name="list">` section should only contain the `limit` (limitbox) field.

### Language String Patterns
- **`_HEADING_` in column header constants**: Flag any `COM_{NAME}_HEADING_{FIELD}` language constants. The correct convention is `COM_{NAME}_COLUMN_{FIELD}`. Joomla core strings (`JGRID_HEADING_ID`, `JSTATUS`, `JGLOBAL_TITLE`, etc.) are exempt — only custom/entity-specific column constants must use `_COLUMN_`.

### Controller Patterns
- **`$this->app` is correct in MVC controllers**: `BaseController` always sets `$this->app` in the constructor. `getApplication()` does NOT exist on MVC controllers — do not flag `$this->app` usage there.
- **Missing `$this->checkToken()`**: All state-changing controller methods (save, delete, export, import, publish) MUST call `$this->checkToken()`.

### Bootstrap / Frontend Patterns
- **`new bootstrap.Modal()`**: Joomla 5 loads Bootstrap as ES modules — the global `bootstrap` object does not exist. Flag any JavaScript using `new bootstrap.Modal()`, `bootstrap.Collapse`, etc.
  - **Fix**: Use `HTMLHelper::_('bootstrap.modal', '#modalId')` in PHP to load the module, then use `data-bs-toggle`/`data-bs-target` attributes in HTML.
- **Toolbar buttons opening modals**: When a `standardButton` should open a modal instead of submitting the form, it MUST use `->onclick('')` to suppress the default `Joomla.submitbutton()` call. Without this, the form submits and the page reloads. Use `->listCheck(true)` if the button should be disabled until list items are selected.
- **Inline `<script>` without Web Asset Manager**: Prefer extracting JS to separate files loaded via `$wa = $this->getDocument()->getWebAssetManager()`. Inline scripts should be minimal (e.g., wiring data-attributes on toolbar buttons).
- **Missing `form.validate` in edit views**: Any HtmlView whose template `<form>` has `class="form-validate"` MUST load the form validator via `$this->document->getWebAssetManager()->useScript('form.validate')` in `display()`. Without this, Save/Apply toolbar buttons fail with: `document.formvalidator is undefined`.

### File Upload Patterns
- **Extension-only validation**: File uploads must validate both file extension AND MIME type (via `finfo`). Extension alone is trivially spoofable.
- **Missing size limits**: All file uploads should enforce a reasonable size limit.

**Remember**: You are providing expert-level code review with complete traceability, evidence-based recommendations, and actionable improvement guidance that elevates code quality and reduces technical debt.
