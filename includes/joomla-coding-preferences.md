## Joomla First Philosophy

**Always use Joomla's built-in classes, patterns, and MVC architecture before reaching for custom solutions or raw PHP.** Joomla provides a complete framework — use it. Every database write goes through a Table class. Every list/form page uses a ListModel/FormModel. Every service uses a Model that uses a Table. No exceptions.

## Coding Standards for Joomla projects

### Namespacing Guidelines
- All namespacing at the top of each file should be in alphabetical order for any Joomla task/project
- All component Classes namespaced under _vendor_\_name_ 
- 
### Class & File Naming — Case Convention (Joomla `ucfirst` Resolution)

**Rule:** In every class name the **entity segment must be a single word** — one leading uppercase letter, all remaining letters lowercase. Recognised Joomla **type suffixes** keep their normal casing. A file name **must match its class name exactly** (PSR-4).

```text
✅ UserprofileModel             ❌ UserProfileModel
✅ ReviewactionTable            ❌ ReviewActionTable
✅ View/Spacepartner/HtmlView   ❌ View/SpacePartner/HtmlView
✅ PartnerexportimportService   ❌ PartnerExportImportService
✅ Publicationstate (enum)      ❌ PublicationState
```

**Recognised type suffixes** (retain PascalCase): `Controller`, `Model`, `DataModel`, `View` / `HtmlView`, `Table`, `Service`, `Field`, `Helper`, `Dispatcher`, `Component`. Everything before the suffix is the entity segment and must be one word. Classes with **no** recognised suffix (Enums, value objects such as `Importresult`) are treated as all-entity and must also be a single word.

`Component` covers the extension entry-point class in `src/Extension/`. The entity segment still collapses to one word, so a two-word entity gives `SpacepartnerComponent`, not `Spacepartnercomponent`. The class is instantiated by explicit FQCN from `services/provider.php`, placing it in the convention-only tier, and every Joomla extension names it `<Entity>Component` alongside core's own `MVCComponent`.

**Why this exists.** Joomla resolves MVC and form-field names from request/config strings via effectively `ucfirst(strtolower($name))` — it capitalises **only the first letter** and never restores internal capitals. So `&view=userprofile` resolves to class `Userprofile…`; a class named `UserProfile…` is never produced by the resolver. Because `createModel()` / `createTable()` / `getModel()` already lowercase-then-`ucfirst` the name they are handed, the names passed to them are kept all-lowercase — which is exactly why the target class can only ever be a single capitalised word.

**Why it hides on Windows and breaks on Linux.** PSR-4 autoloading maps the class name to a file path. On case-**insensitive** filesystems (Windows, default macOS) `UserProfileModel.php` is still found when the resolver asks for `Userprofilemodel.php`, so the bug is invisible during local development. On case-**sensitive** filesystems (Linux) the lookup fails with a fatal *class not found*. Code that runs fine on a Windows dev machine breaks on a Linux server.

**Relationship to PSR.** PSR-1/PSR-12 mandate `StudlyCaps` class names, which would *permit* multi-word `UserProfile`. This Joomla convention is **stricter** — it narrows the entity segment to a single word — and wins wherever the two differ for name-resolved classes. PSR-4 (autoloading) is what makes the case mismatch fatal on Linux; PSR-12 (formatting) is orthogonal and unaffected.

**Risk tiers.**
- **Breaks at runtime on Linux** — classes resolved *by name*: `Controller`, `Model`, `View` folder, `Table`, form `Field`. Multi-word names here are functional bugs.
- **Convention-only (works today, still non-compliant)** — classes resolved *by explicit FQCN* via DI / `provider.php`: `Service`, `DataModel`, `Enum`, value objects, `Helper`, `Component`. These must still be single-word for consistency.

**Multi-word entities** collapse to one lowercase-after-first token: `UserProfile → Userprofile`, `SpacePartner → Spacepartner`, `AuditLog → Auditlog`, `IncidentType → Incidenttype`, `ExportPartners → Exportpartners`. Only folders that contain **classes** (`Controller/`, `Model/`, `Table/`, `View/<Entity>/`, `Service/`, `Field/`, `Enum/`, `Helper/`) follow this case convention — non-class folders (`tmpl/`, `forms/`, `language/`, `media/`) are already all-lowercase and are correct as-is.

- ### Code Standards
- PHP 8.3+ language features (constructor promotion, readonly properties, enums, match expressions, typed class constants, `#[Override]` attribute)
- Modern PSR-4 autoloading with Joomla namespaced classes
- Joomla 4.x/5.x conventions and security practices

### `#[Override]` — Match Parent Method Signatures Exactly
- When overriding a method with `#[Override]`, the child method signature **MUST exactly match** the parent method's parameter types, default values, and return type
- **Before writing any override**, read or look up the parent class method to confirm its exact signature — do NOT assume types or add types the parent does not declare
- Joomla's core classes often omit type declarations (e.g. `$id = null` without `?int`, no return type). The override must match this — adding types the parent lacks causes a PHP `Compile Error`
- Common pitfall: `Table::_getAssetParentId(?Table $table = null, $id = null)` has **no type on `$id`** and **no return type** — overrides must not add `?int $id` or `: int`
- This applies to all framework classes (Table, Model, Controller, View, etc.) — always verify before overriding
- All files include `defined('_JEXEC') or die;` protection
- Uses container-based dependency injection
- PHPDoc comments for all public methods and properties
### Reference Libraries
- Always consult https://context7.com/context7/developer_joomla-coding-standards library for additional coding standards reference
- Refer to additional context7 libraries located in @.claude/includes/context7.json before starting any tasks
- Always use the latest version of the context7 libraries

### Input Handling
- NEVER access PHP superglobals (`$_REQUEST`, `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_COOKIE`) directly. Always use Joomla's `InputInterface` via `$this->app->getInput()` or `Factory::getApplication()->getInput()`.
- Use typed getter methods: `$input->getInt()`, `$input->getString()`, `$input->getCmd()`, etc.
- For HikaShop legacy plugins, use `$this->app->getInput()` (available via the parent class) — NOT `hikaInput::get()` or raw superglobals.
- Filter and validate all input at the point of retrieval. Never trust client-supplied values for security-sensitive decisions (e.g., payment status).

### Joomla Classes — Use Instead of Raw PHP

| Need | Use Joomla Class | NOT |
|------|-----------------|-----|
| Application instance | `Factory::getApplication()` | Global variables |
| Database access | `$this->getDatabase()` (in Models/Tables) | `new PDO()` or raw `mysqli` |
| User input | `$app->getInput()` or `InputFilter` | `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_REQUEST` |
| Current user | `Factory::getApplication()->getIdentity()` | `$_SESSION` |
| URLs | `Uri::root()`, `Uri::base()`, `Route::_()` | Hardcoded URLs |
| Dates | `new Joomla\CMS\Date\Date()` | `date()`, `new \DateTime()` |
| Language/i18n | `Text::_('COM_KEY')`, `Text::sprintf()` | Hardcoded strings |
| File operations | `File::copy()`, `Folder::create()` | `copy()`, `mkdir()` |
| Mail | `Factory::getMailer()` | `mail()`, `PHPMailer` directly |
| Session | `Factory::getApplication()->getSession()` | `$_SESSION` |
| Config values | `ComponentHelper::getParams('com_name')` | Hardcoded config |
| Events | `DispatcherInterface` + `EventInterface` | Custom observer pattern |
| Logging | `Log::add()` | `error_log()`, `file_put_contents()` |
| HTTP client | `HttpFactory::getHttp()` | `curl_*()`, `file_get_contents()` |
| HTTP response code | `$response->getStatusCode()` | `$response->code` |
| Input filter | `new InputFilter(...)` | `InputFilter::getInstance(...)` |
| Pagination | `Pagination` class in ListModel | Custom pagination |
| Form handling | `Form` class with XML definitions | Manual HTML forms |
| Access control | `$user->authorise()` | Custom permission checks |
| Categories | `CategoriesServiceInterface` | Custom category trees |

### HTTP Response — PSR-7 `getStatusCode()`, Not `->code`
- `HttpFactory::getHttp()->post()` / `->get()` returns `Joomla\Http\Response` which extends `Laminas\Diactoros\Response` (PSR-7)
- PSR-7 responses expose the status code via `getStatusCode()` — there is **no public `$code` property**
- **Always use `$response->getStatusCode()`**, never `$response->code`
- The body is accessed via `$response->getBody()->__toString()` or `(string) $response->getBody()`

### Framework Class Instantiation — No `getInstance()`
- Joomla Framework 2.0+ classes (under `Joomla\Filter\`, `Joomla\Input\`, etc.) use plain constructors — they do NOT have `getInstance()` static factory methods
- The old CMS wrapper classes (e.g., `Joomla\CMS\Filter\InputFilter`) had `getInstance()`, but the framework classes do not
- **Always use `new ClassName(...)` for Joomla Framework classes**, never `ClassName::getInstance()`
- Common mistake: `InputFilter::getInstance($tags, $attrs, ...)` — correct: `new InputFilter($tags, $attrs, ...)`
- This applies to all `Joomla\Filter\*`, `Joomla\Input\*`, and similar framework-level classes

### Design Patterns
- Do NOT use the Repository design pattern in Joomla extensions. Use Joomla's native Model pattern (`ListModel`, `FormModel`, `AdminModel`, `BaseDatabaseModel`) for all data access.
- Models handle database queries, state management, and business logic — there is no need for a separate Repository layer.
- Services MUST NOT access the database directly. All data access flows through DataModel methods.

### MVC Pattern: Controller → Model → Table

For admin list/form pages with standard CRUD operations:

```
Controller (AdminController/FormController)
    → Model (ListModel for lists, AdminModel for forms)
        → Table (extends Joomla\CMS\Table\Table)
            → Database
```

- **Controller**: Handles HTTP requests, checks ACL, delegates to Model
- **Model**: Query building, state management, validation, calls Table for writes
- **Table**: Single-row CRUD — `save()`, `delete()`, `publish()`, `check()`, `bind()`

#### Standard Toolbar Buttons (Modern API)

Admin views use `$toolbar = $this->getDocument()->getToolbar()` to access the toolbar object, then call instance methods. Use `ToolbarHelper::title()` for the page title (NOT deprecated).

| Button | Method |
|--------|--------|
| New | `$toolbar->addNew('{entity}.add')` |
| Delete / Empty Trash | `$toolbar->delete('{entities}.delete', 'JTOOLBAR_EMPTY_TRASH')->message('JGLOBAL_CONFIRM_DELETE')->listCheck(true)` |
| Publish | `$toolbar->publish('{entities}.publish')->listCheck(true)` |
| Unpublish | `$toolbar->unpublish('{entities}.unpublish')->listCheck(true)` |
| Archive | `$toolbar->archive('{entities}.archive')->listCheck(true)` |
| Trash | `$toolbar->trash('{entities}.trash')->listCheck(true)` |
| Apply | `$toolbar->apply('{entity}.apply')` |
| Save | `$toolbar->save('{entity}.save')` |
| Save & New | `$toolbar->save2new('{entity}.save2new')` |
| Save as Copy | `$toolbar->save2copy('{entity}.save2copy')` |
| Cancel / Close | `$toolbar->cancel('{entity}.cancel', 'JTOOLBAR_CLOSE')` |
| Options | `$toolbar->preferences('com_{name}')` |

**Delete and Trash are not peers — never offer Delete without Trash.** Joomla deletes in
two steps: trash the record (`state = -2`), then purge it from the Trashed filter.
`canDelete()` refuses any record that is not already trashed, and it does so **before** the
ACL check, so no permission level — Super User included — can delete a record straight from
the default list. A Delete button offered there can never succeed; it returns
`JLIB_APPLICATION_ERROR_DELETE_NOT_PERMITTED` ("Delete not permitted"), which reads as a
permissions failure and sends administrators auditing an ACL matrix that is fine.

Offer **Trash** in the normal view and **Empty Trash** only where trashed records are
visible. Adding the trash button is the whole change — `AdminController` already registers
the `trash` task and maps it to `-2`. Full pattern, including the two gating variants and
how to restrict Empty Trash to a higher permission:
`includes/joomla-trash-delete-pattern.md`.

### Model → Table Relationship (Critical Rule)

**Models MUST NOT write directly to the database via raw SQL.** All database writes go through Table classes:

```php
// ✓ CORRECT — Model uses Table for writes
$table = $this->getTable();
$table->bind($data);
$table->check();
$table->store();

// ✓ CORRECT — Table methods for state changes
$table->publish($pks, $value);
$table->delete($pk);

// ✗ WRONG — Raw SQL in Model
$db->setQuery('UPDATE #__items SET state = 1 WHERE id = ' . $id)->execute();

// ✗ WRONG — Direct insert/update queries in Model
$query->insert('#__items')->columns(...)->values(...);
$db->setQuery($query)->execute();
```

**Models MAY use raw SQL for SELECT queries** (read operations) — this is normal for building list queries in `getListQuery()`. The rule is: **reads via query builder, writes via Table**.

**Documented exceptions (bulk import / migration only).** Two cases warrant a deliberate,
commented deviation, covered in full in `joomla-chunked-import-pattern.md`:
1. **Explicit-PK inserts** — when preserving a source system's IDs as primary keys, override the
   Table's `store()` so it still runs `bind()`/`check()` validation but writes via
   `$db->insertObject()` (Joomla's `store()` mis-routes a pre-assigned PK to a 0-row UPDATE).
2. **Set-based / atomic writes** — bulk moves, atomic counter increments, and aggregate rebuilds
   that have no single owning row may use raw `->update()` in the DataModel. Annotate each with a
   `Direct SQL exception: <reason>` comment and always parameter-bind.

These are exceptions, not a general license — ordinary per-record writes still go through `store()`.

### Manifest XML Naming
- Component manifest files MUST be named `{name}.xml` (e.g. `forum.xml`, `community.xml`), **NOT** `com_{name}.xml`.
- The manifest lives inside the admin folder: `admin/com_{name}/{name}.xml`.
- This matches Joomla's convention where the manifest filename is the extension name without the `com_` prefix.

### Configuration Parameters
- Extension configuration parameters MUST be defined in a separate `config.xml` file, NOT embedded as `<config>` blocks inside the extension's manifest XML file (`{name}.xml`).
- The manifest XML is for extension metadata, installation instructions, namespace, and file declarations only.
- This applies to all extension types: components, modules, and plugins.

### Language Files — `.ini` vs `.sys.ini`
- A key rendered **outside the component's own execution** MUST be defined in `{name}.sys.ini`, not the regular `{name}.ini`. The regular `.ini` is loaded only while the component itself runs, so any string shown by another part of Joomla falls back to the raw key (e.g. `COM_EXAMPLE_SUBMENU_ITEMS` displayed literally).
- Belongs in `.sys.ini`:
  - Manifest `<name>`, `<administration><menu>`, and `<submenu><menu>` labels — rendered as `#__menu` admin-menu titles by the admin template / `mod_menu`.
  - Site menu-item type metadata in `site/.../tmpl/{view}/default.xml` — the `<layout title="...">` and `<message>` strings. `com_menus` (`MenutypesModel`) loads `{option}.sys` from the administrator when a user adds a menu item.
  - The extension `<description>` (`COM_EXAMPLE_XML_DESCRIPTION`).
- Stays in the regular `.ini` (loaded by `com_config`/the component itself when those screens render):
  - `config.xml` field labels and descriptions.
  - `access.xml` action titles (Permissions tab).
  - All strings the component's own controllers, models, views, and templates emit.
- Menu/menu-item language key segments are UPPERCASE (`COM_EXAMPLE_ITEMS_MENU`, not `COM_EXAMPLE_items_MENU`) — the view-name segment is capitalised like every other key.
- **Admin and site have separate `.ini` files and the front end loads ONLY the site one.** Any key a site view/template renders (toolbar labels, error messages, field labels, titles) MUST exist in `site/.../language/{tag}/{name}.ini`, even when the admin `.ini` already defines it. Duplicating shared keys across both files is normal and expected in Joomla — the two files do not share a namespace at runtime.
- When generating language files, split keys by **where each key is rendered** (admin screen, site screen, or outside-component `.sys`), never by a name-prefix heuristic — prefix-matching silently drops keys that do not fit the pattern (a real cause of raw keys like `COM_EXAMPLE_TOOLBAR_EXPORT` on the front end).
- Verify by resolving through the actual loader path, not by eye: `$lang->load('{option}.sys', JPATH_ADMINISTRATOR)` (or `$lang->load('{option}', JPATH_SITE . '/components/{option}')` for the front end) then `Text::_($key)` must return the translation, not the key. Better still, load the rendered screen over authenticated HTTP and grep for raw `COM_*` constants.

### Repository Folder Structure
- Components are stored in `Components/com_{name}/` with `admin/`, `api/`, `media/`, and `site/` as peer subdirectories.
- The `/api` folder is a subfolder of the component — NOT a top-level directory.
- The `/src` folder belongs inside each component layer (e.g., `admin/src/`), NOT at the repository root.
- The `/tmpl` folder is at the same level as `/src` within each layer — NOT a subdirectory of `/View`.
- Plugins are stored in `Plugins/{group}/{name}/`.
- Build configuration goes in the `Phing/` directory.
- See `includes/joomla-devel-environment.md` for the full repository structure reference.

### Version Synchronisation (V.R.M)
- The extension version follows **V.R.M** (Version.Release.Modification) format (e.g. `0.0.5`)
- **Reset rules when incrementing**:
  - Incrementing **V** (version) resets both **R** and **M** to `0` (e.g. `1.2.3` → `2.0.0`)
  - Incrementing **R** (release) resets **M** to `0` (e.g. `1.2.3` → `1.3.0`)
  - Incrementing **M** (modification) changes only **M** (e.g. `1.2.3` → `1.2.4`)
- **Two files MUST stay in sync**:
  1. **SQL update file**: `sql/updates/mysql/{V.R.M}.sql`
  2. **Manifest XML**: `<version>` element in `admin/com_{name}/{name}.xml`
- **The manifest is the single source of truth for the version.** The Phing build file MUST read it at build time rather than carrying a hardcoded literal:
  ```xml
  <xmlproperty file="${sourcedir}/admin/${ext_prefix}${ext_name}/${ext_name}.xml" prefix="mf" keepRoot="true" />
  <property name="version" value="${mf.extension.version}" override="true" />
  ```
  Add a fail-fast guard at the top of the `build` target — Phing leaves an unresolved property as its literal token and would otherwise emit `com_example..zip`:
  ```xml
  <fail message="Could not read &lt;version&gt; from ${ext_name}.xml - check the manifest path.">
      <condition>
          <contains string="${version}" substring="mf.extension" />
      </condition>
  </fail>
  ```
  A build file still holding `<property name="version" value="X.Y.Z" .../>` is legacy — convert it to the pattern above instead of updating the literal.
- **When bumping the version**, also review the `<creationDate>` element in the manifest XML and update it to the current date (e.g. `<creationDate>yyyy-mm-dd</creationDate>`) if it does not reflect the current date

### PHPDoc `@since` Tags — Track the Manifest Version
- **New or changed code MUST be tagged with the owning extension's current manifest `<version>`.** Do **not** guess a value or copy the highest `@since` already present in the codebase — existing tags may have drifted out of step with the manifest.
- **Read the manifest before writing the tag**:
  - Component code → `admin/com_{name}/{name}.xml` `<version>`
  - Plugin code → that plugin's manifest `<version>` (e.g. `plugins/{group}/{name}/{name}.xml`)
  - Module code → that module's manifest `<version>`
- A change that spans more than one extension uses **each extension's own** manifest version for its respective files (e.g. plugin source = plugin manifest version; the component table/SQL it touches = component manifest version).
- Because `@since` tracks the manifest, it advances in lockstep with the V.R.M bump above: when a change warrants a version bump, new symbols added in that change carry the new version; pre-existing symbols keep their original `@since`.

### SQL Update File Management

SQL update files in `sql/updates/mysql/` are versioned and **immutable once committed to git**. The following rule governs how and when SQL changes are written:

#### The Git-Stage Rule

> **A SQL update file may only be written to if it is unstaged (untracked or modified) in git.**
> A committed SQL file is considered **sealed** — it belongs to a previous release and must never be modified.

#### Decision Flow — When Writing SQL Changes

Before writing any ALTER TABLE, CREATE TABLE, or other schema SQL:

1. **Check git status** for the SQL updates directory (`sql/updates/mysql/`).
2. **If an unstaged/untracked `.sql` file exists** — it is the current work-in-progress file. Write the SQL statements into this file.
3. **If no unstaged `.sql` file exists** — all existing files are committed (sealed). A new file must be created:
   - Read the highest version number from existing `.sql` filenames in the directory.
   - Increment **M** (modification) by 1 to calculate the next version (e.g. `2.4.2` → `2.4.3`).
   - Create the new file `{next-version}.sql` and write the SQL statements into it.
4. **Do NOT update the manifest XML or Phing build file** at this stage — version synchronisation happens later during the version-bump step.

#### Why This Approach

- **Prevents accidental writes to sealed files** — committed SQL files belong to deployed releases and must not change.
- **Auto-creates the target file** — agents and developers don't need to manually bump before starting work that includes schema changes.
- **Multiple SQL changes accumulate** — all schema changes during a development session go into the same unstaged file.
- **Version-bump reconciles at the end** — the `/version-bump` skill detects the unstaged SQL file and either keeps its name (modification) or renames it (release/version bump) to match the final version, then syncs the manifest and Phing files.

#### Example Workflow

```
Existing committed files: 2.4.0.sql, 2.4.1.sql, 2.4.2.sql

1. Agent needs to add a column → checks git status → no unstaged .sql files
   → Creates 2.4.3.sql with ALTER TABLE statement

2. Agent needs another schema change → checks git status → 2.4.3.sql is unstaged
   → Appends to 2.4.3.sql

3. All code changes complete → user runs /version-bump
   - If changes are a bugfix → /version-bump modification → 2.4.3.sql stays as-is, manifest + Phing set to 2.4.3
   - If changes are a feature → /version-bump release → 2.4.3.sql renamed to 2.5.0.sql, manifest + Phing set to 2.5.0
```

#### Manifest Wiring — `<update><schemas>` Is Mandatory

Writing update files is not enough. Joomla only looks at `sql/updates/{driver}/` if the manifest declares a schema path:

```xml
<update>
    <schemas>
        <schemapath type="mysql">sql/updates/mysql</schemapath>
    </schemas>
</update>
```

`InstallerAdapter::parseQueries()` gates **both** halves of the lifecycle on this element existing:

| Route | Method called | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `install` / `discover_install` | `Installer::setSchemaVersion()` | Records the **highest** update filename in `#__schemas` as the baseline |
| `update` | `Installer::parseSchemaUpdates()` | Runs every file with a version greater than the recorded baseline |

**The trap**: if an extension shipped without this block, no `#__schemas` row was ever written. `parseSchemaUpdates()` treats a missing row as version `'0.0.0'` and therefore **replays every update file from the beginning**. Adding the block to a mature extension triggers this on the next update.

This is not a soft failure. A failing statement makes `parseSchemaUpdates()` return `false`, which makes `parseQueries()` throw `RuntimeException` — **the entire update aborts and rolls back**.

#### Making Update SQL Replay-Safe — `/** CAN FAIL **/`

Plain `ADD COLUMN` / `ADD INDEX` / `DROP COLUMN` statements error when replayed against a database that already has the change. Mark any statement that is safe to skip with Joomla's marker (`Installer::CAN_FAIL_MARKER`, available since Joomla 4.2):

```sql
-- Replay-safe: installer strips the marker and swallows this statement's error
ALTER TABLE `#__example` ADD COLUMN `notes` text NULL /** CAN FAIL **/;
ALTER TABLE `#__example` ADD INDEX idx_state (`state`) /** CAN FAIL **/;
```

- The marker goes **immediately before the terminating semicolon**, with no space between `**/` and `;` — the installer matches on the last 17 characters of the statement.
- It suppresses only that one statement; the rest of the file still runs.
- `MODIFY` / `CHANGE` and `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` are already idempotent and do not need it.
- Empty `.sql` files are harmless — only a `file_get_contents()` of `false` aborts, and an empty buffer simply yields no queries. They are valid as version markers.

#### The Install Script Must Be Schema-Complete

Because a fresh install pins `#__schemas` straight to the newest update filename, **update files never run on a fresh install**. The install script is therefore the complete current schema, not the original schema.

> **Every schema change written to an update file MUST also be applied to `sql/install.mysql.utf8.sql`.**

Keep the two in agreement on column order (mirror the `AFTER` clauses), index names, engine, and collation. Drift here means fresh and upgraded installs silently diverge — a class of bug that surfaces only on a customer's new site.

#### Install and Uninstall Must Not Destroy Data

Data tables are removed **manually by the administrator**, never automatically:

- **No `DROP TABLE` at the top of the install script.** Rely on `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` alone so install and reinstall are non-destructive.
- **No `<uninstall>` SQL block** for data tables in the manifest — uninstalling leaves the table in place.

Both halves are required. A `DROP TABLE` in the install script silently defeats the uninstall policy, because reinstalling would wipe the table anyway. Leave a comment in the SQL recording that the omission is deliberate, so it is not "fixed" later.

Also audit `sql/uninstall.*.sql` for copy-paste leftovers naming another extension's tables — an unreferenced file is inert, but becomes destructive the moment someone wires it up.

### Git Commit Message Convention — Conventional Commits
- All projects MUST use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) syntax
- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description> [<version>]`
- **type** (required): `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `build`, `perf`, `test`, `style`, `ci`
- **scope** (required): extension name (e.g. `com_forum`, `plg_webservices_forum`) or `project` for cross-cutting changes
- **description** (required): imperative mood, lowercase, no trailing period
- **version** (when applicable): `[V.R.M]` appended to subject when the manifest version has changed
- The version number is read from the `<version>` element in the extension's manifest XML
- Examples:
  - `feat(com_forum): add hits column to boards, topics, and messages [0.1.1]`
  - `fix(com_forum): prevent null column errors with CheckDefaultsTrait`
  - `refactor(com_forum): delegate all database access to DataModels [0.1.0]`
  - `docs(com_community): update language files for space entity`
  - `build(plg_webservices_forum): update Phing build for new API routes [1.0.0]`
  - `chore(project): update shared documentation files`
- For commits touching multiple extensions, create separate commits per extension
- A `commit-msg` git hook SHOULD be used to enforce the format in each repository

### DatabaseQuery `bind()` — By-Reference Gotcha
- `DatabaseQuery::bind()` accepts its value parameter **by reference** (`&$value`)
- **Never reuse a loop variable** across multiple `bind()` calls — all bindings will point to the final value of the variable
- Store each value in a separate array element so each binding has a stable reference:
  ```php
  // WRONG — $value is overwritten each iteration, all binds point to last value
  foreach (['scope', 'affiliation'] as $field) {
      $value = $this->getState('filter.' . $field);
      if ($value !== '') {
          $query->where($db->quoteName($field) . ' = :' . $field)
              ->bind(':' . $field, $value);
      }
  }

  // CORRECT — each array element is a distinct reference
  $filterValues = [];
  foreach (['scope', 'affiliation'] as $field) {
      $filterValues[$field] = $this->getState('filter.' . $field);
      if ($filterValues[$field] !== null && $filterValues[$field] !== '') {
          $query->where($db->quoteName($field) . ' = :' . $field)
              ->bind(':' . $field, $filterValues[$field]);
      }
  }
  ```
- **Never pass an expression or function-call result directly to `bind()`.** Because the value is taken by reference, only a variable is a legal argument. Passing `trim($name)`, `(int) $id`, `$a . $b`, a ternary, or any other expression triggers PHP's **"Only variables can be passed by reference"** error (the IDE flags it too). Assign the computed value to a variable first, then bind the variable:
  ```php
  // WRONG — trim() returns a value, not a variable → "Only variables can be passed by reference"
  if (is_string($name) && trim($name) !== '') {
      $query->where($db->quoteName('a.name') . ' = :name')
          ->bind(':name', trim($name), ParameterType::STRING);
  }

  // CORRECT — compute into a variable, then bind that variable
  $name = trim((string) $name);
  if ($name !== '') {
      $query->where($db->quoteName('a.name') . ' = :name')
          ->bind(':name', $name, ParameterType::STRING);
  }
  ```
  This applies to every `bind()` argument — casts, concatenations, method calls, and ternaries must all be resolved into a variable before the `bind()` call.

### SQL Filter Fields — Exclude NULL Values
- SQL-type filter fields in form XML (`type="sql"`) that use `SELECT DISTINCT` can return `NULL` values from the database
- On PHP 8.1+, passing `NULL` to Joomla's `Select` helper triggers deprecation warnings in `trim()` and `explode()`
- Always add `WHERE column IS NOT NULL AND column != ''` and `ORDER BY column` to filter field queries:
  ```xml
  <field name="scope" type="sql"
         query="SELECT DISTINCT scope AS value, scope AS scope FROM #__example_items WHERE scope IS NOT NULL AND scope != '' ORDER BY scope"
         label="FILTER_SCOPE" onchange="this.form.submit();">
      <option value="">FILTER_SCOPE</option>
  </field>
  ```

### Preferred `getListQuery()` Pattern — Delegate to `LocalTraits` Helpers

**This is the required shape for every `ListModel::getListQuery()`.** Ordering, published state,
search and each filter-bar column are handled by a single-purpose helper on the component's
`LocalTraits` trait. The query method stays a flat, readable declaration of *what* the list needs —
never *how* each clause is built. No `if` blocks, no inline `bind()` calls, no repeated
`where()`/`quoteName()` boilerplate in the model.

Canonical example: `com_inventorydata` — `administrator/components/com_inventorydata/src/View/Savedlists/HtmlView.php`
paired with `.../src/Model/SavedlistsModel.php`. (`com_emporium` carries the same `LocalTraits`
setters but has not yet moved the two lists out of its models; `com_mapper` still declares both in
the model/constructor and is **not** a reference for this pattern.)

**`filter_fields` and `haystack` belong to the View, not the model constructor.** Both lists
describe the *template* — which column headings `searchtools.sort` offers, and what the search box
matches — so they live beside it in the list view and are pushed into the model before
`getItems()`. Do not pass them through `$config` in `__construct()`, and do not hard-code them in
the model.

```php
// View/Savedlists/HtmlView.php
class HtmlView extends BaseHtmlView
{
    /**
     * Columns the list may be ordered and filtered by.
     *
     * An allow list, not documentation: ListModel::populateState() refuses any list.ordering
     * absent here and falls back to the default, and setListOrdering() puts the column into
     * ORDER BY through escape(), which does not make an identifier safe. Every column offered
     * by searchtools.sort in the template must appear here — otherwise that heading looks
     * sortable and silently is not — and every entry must be a column the list query selects.
     */
    private array $filter_fields = [
        'id', 'a.id',
        'list_name', 'a.list_name',
        'list_type', 'a.list_type',
        'state', 'a.state',
        'created', 'a.created',
    ];

    /** Columns the search box matches against with LIKE. */
    private array $haystack = [
        'a.list_name',
        'a.owner_reference',
    ];

    public function display($tpl = null): void
    {
        $model = $this->getModel();

        // MUST precede getItems(), which triggers populateState() and the ordering check.
        $model->setFilterFields($this->filter_fields);
        $model->setHaystack($this->haystack);

        $this->items         = $model->getItems();
        $this->pagination    = $model->getPagination();
        $this->state         = $model->getState();
        $this->filterForm    = $model->getFilterForm();
        $this->activeFilters = $model->getActiveFilters();

        $this->addToolbar();

        parent::display($tpl);
    }
}
```

```php
// Model/SavedlistsModel.php — no __construct(), no filter_fields, no haystack literal
class SavedlistsModel extends ListModel
{
    use LocalTraits;

    /**
     * Table this list is built from, and the alias the query uses for it. Consumed by
     * setFrom(); the alias is what makes 'a.id' the correct qualified column to hand
     * setFilterSearch().
     */
    protected string $_tbl       = '#__bricks_inventory_savedlists';
    protected string $_tbl_alias = 'a';

    protected function getStoreId($id = ''): string
    {
        // One line per filter — MUST mirror the filters applied in getListQuery()
        $id .= ':' . $this->getState('filter.search');
        $id .= ':' . $this->getState('filter.published');
        $id .= ':' . $this->getState('filter.list_type');

        return parent::getStoreId($id);
    }

    protected function getListQuery(): QueryInterface
    {
        $db = $this->resolveDb();

        $this->getQuery();
        $this->setFrom();
        $query = $this->query;

        $query->select([
            $db->quoteName('a.id'),
            $db->quoteName('a.list_name'),
            $db->quoteName('a.list_type'),
            $db->quoteName('a.state'),
            $db->quoteName('a.created'),
        ]);

        // An unset filter shows published and unpublished but not trashed.
        $this->setPublishedState($this, ['column' => 'a.state', 'default' => [0, 1]]);

        $this->setFilterColumn($this, 'list_type');

        $this->setListOrdering($this, null, ['column' => 'a.id', 'direction' => 'DESC']);

        // ALWAYS last — see the setFilterSearch() rule below. The id: form is alias-qualified
        // because a joined table may also carry an id.
        $this->setFilterSearch($this, $this->haystack, 'a.id');

        return $query;
    }
}
```

The two setters live on `LocalTraits` beside the query helpers, and the trait declares the backing
property so `$this->haystack` is never a dynamic property:

```php
trait LocalTraits
{
    protected ?array $haystack = null;

    /** Sets the filter_fields allow list used by ListModel::populateState(). */
    public function setFilterFields(array $fields): void
    {
        $this->filter_fields = $fields;
    }

    /** Sets the columns setFilterSearch() matches against with LIKE. */
    public function setHaystack(array $fields): void
    {
        $this->haystack = $fields;
    }
}
```

**`LocalTraits` query-building contract** — every component's `LocalTraits` provides these:

| Method | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| `getQuery(?object &$query = null, bool $value = true)` | Creates the query object into `$this->query` (or into the passed reference) |
| `setFrom(?object &$query, ?string $table, ?string $alias)` | `FROM` clause from `$this->_tbl` (or an override) with optional alias |
| `setListOrdering(?object $model, ?array $options, array $default)` | `ORDER BY` from `list.ordering` / `list.direction` state, with a default |
| `setPublishedState(?object $model, ?array $options)` | `WHERE state = :state` from `filter.published`; skipped for `*` or non-numeric |
| `setFilterColumn(object $model, string $column)` | `WHERE {column} = :{column}` from `filter.{column}`; skipped when null/empty |
| `setFilterSearch(?object $model, ?array $haystack, string $idColumn = 'id')` | `id:N` lookup, otherwise `LIKE` across every haystack column, OR-grouped; alias-qualify $idColumn when the query joins another table that also carries an `id` |
| `setFilterFields(array $fields)` | Public setter — the View pushes its `filter_fields` allow list in before `getItems()` |
| `setHaystack(array $fields)` | Public setter — the View pushes its search-column list in before `getItems()` |
| `sqlDump($query)` | Resolved SQL for debugging — see below |

**Rules**

- **One filter, one call.** Each filter-bar column is exactly one `setFilterColumn()` line. Never
  hand-roll a `where()`/`bind()` pair in the model for something a helper already covers.
- **New filter shape → new helper.** When a filter cannot be expressed by an existing helper
  (date range, `IN` list, JOINed column, `NULL` check), add a named helper to `LocalTraits`
  (`setFilterDateRange()`, `setFilterInList()`, …) and call it from `getListQuery()`. Do **not**
  inline the logic — the helper is where the binding gotchas get solved once.
- **Call order is fixed**: `setListOrdering()` → `setPublishedState()` → column filters →
  `setFilterSearch()` last. See the next section for why search must be last.
- **`getStoreId()` mirrors the filters.** Every filter applied in `getListQuery()` gets a line in
  `getStoreId()`, or cached results leak between filter states.
- **`filter_fields` and `haystack` are set by the View**, never through `$config` in the model
  constructor and never hard-coded in the model — `$model->setFilterFields()` and
  `$model->setHaystack()` are called in `HtmlView::display()` **before** `getItems()`, because
  `getItems()` triggers `populateState()` and the ordering check.
- **`filter_fields`** must list every sortable column offered by `searchtools.sort` in the
  template, in both bare and alias-qualified form (`'id', 'a.id'`), or `list.ordering` is
  silently rejected by `ListModel::populateState()` and the heading looks sortable while doing
  nothing. It is an allow list, not documentation: `setListOrdering()` puts the column into
  `ORDER BY` through `escape()`, which does not make an identifier safe.
- **No leftover debug.** Never commit `$x = $items->query->dump();` — use `sqlDump()` while
  debugging and remove it before commit.
- Site/API/CLI list models **extend the Administrator list model** and override only the extra
  filter — they never repeat this scaffolding. See the DRY layering rules in the builder agents.

### `setFilterSearch()` Must Be Called Last in Query Building
- The `setFilterSearch()` method in `LocalTraits` uses `where($conditions, 'OR')` when no prior WHERE clause exists
- This sets the OR glue for the **entire** WHERE clause, causing all subsequent `->where()` calls to be joined with OR instead of AND
- When a prior WHERE exists, it correctly uses `extendWhere('AND', $conditions, 'OR')` which groups the search terms in parentheses
- **Rule**: In any `getListQuery()` method, always call `setFilterSearch()` **after** all other filters (published state, entity, bin, stock, freshness, etc.) so the OR glue does not leak into other conditions

### SQL Debugging with `sqlDump()`
- The `LocalTraits` trait (in `admin/com_{name}/src/Model/LocalTraits.php`) includes a `sqlDump($query)` method for SQL diagnostics
- It returns the fully resolved SQL with bound parameter values substituted and table prefix replaced
- Use `$this->sqlDump($query)` instead of `$query->dump()` for meaningful debug output
- For quick browser output during debugging: `die($this->sqlDump($products->query));`
- The method must be present in every project's `LocalTraits`:
  ```php
  protected function sqlDump($query) {
      $sql = $this->db->replacePrefix((string) $query);
      foreach ($query->bounded as $key => $bound) {
          $value = is_string($bound->value) ? "'" . $bound->value . "'" : $bound->value;
          $sql = str_replace($key, $value, $sql);
      }
      return $sql;
  }
  ```
- `DatabaseQuery::dump()` is deprecated and only shows placeholders — prefer `sqlDump()` for all SQL diagnostics

### Database Schema
- MySQL8+ and MariaDB 10+ support
- Changes to the database schema to be updated in /sql/updates/mysql/ with version numbers
- Use `DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci` for all tables
- Use `ENGINE=InnoDB` for all tables

#### SQL Update Files — One Operation Per ALTER TABLE

Joomla's Database Checker (`MysqlChangeItem::buildCheckQuery()`) parses each SQL statement in update files and generates a verification query to confirm the change was applied. **It only handles the first operation in each `ALTER TABLE` statement.** Multi-operation statements cause two problems:

1. **`CHANGE` / `MODIFY`** — Trailing commas from subsequent operations leak into the generated `SHOW COLUMNS ... WHERE` check query, producing SQL syntax errors (e.g. `` `default` = NULL, AND `null` = 'YES' ``).
2. **`ADD COLUMN`** — Only the first column is verified; columns 2+ are silently skipped.

**Rule**: Always use **one DDL operation per `ALTER TABLE` statement** in SQL update files.

```sql
-- WRONG — multi-column CHANGE breaks the Database Checker
ALTER TABLE `#__example`
    CHANGE `old_col` `new_col` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    CHANGE `depth` `legacy_depth` INT DEFAULT NULL;

-- CORRECT — separate statements
ALTER TABLE `#__example`
    CHANGE `old_col` `new_col` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT NULL;

ALTER TABLE `#__example`
    CHANGE `depth` `legacy_depth` INT DEFAULT NULL;

-- WRONG — only first ADD COLUMN gets verified
ALTER TABLE `#__example`
    ADD COLUMN `lft` INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    ADD COLUMN `rgt` INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

-- CORRECT — each column individually verified
ALTER TABLE `#__example`
    ADD COLUMN `lft` INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

ALTER TABLE `#__example`
    ADD COLUMN `rgt` INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
```

> **Note**: `CREATE TABLE` statements in `install.mysql.utf8.sql` are NOT affected — the checker only verifies table existence for those. This rule applies to `ALTER TABLE` in update files only.

#### Standard Joomla System Fields for Core/CRUD Tables

Main entity tables where users create, edit, and manage records through CRUD interfaces MUST include these standard Joomla system fields:

```sql
-- Publication & workflow
state TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,           -- 1=published, 0=unpublished, 2=archived, -2=trashed
ordering INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,                -- Display order within lists
access INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,         -- Joomla access level (1=Public, 2=Registered, etc.)

-- Ownership & audit trail
created DATETIME NOT NULL,                      -- Record creation timestamp
created_by INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,     -- Joomla user ID of creator
modified DATETIME,                              -- Last modification timestamp
modified_by INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,    -- Joomla user ID of last modifier

-- Edit locking
checked_out INT UNSIGNED,                       -- User ID who has record checked out for editing
checked_out_time DATETIME,                      -- When the checkout occurred

-- Optional but common on content-like entities
asset_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,       -- Joomla ACL asset reference (for per-item permissions)
alias VARCHAR(400) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',         -- URL-safe slug (for SEF routing)
publish_up DATETIME,                            -- Scheduled publish start
publish_down DATETIME,                          -- Scheduled publish end
language CHAR(7) NOT NULL DEFAULT '*',          -- Language code ('*' = all languages)
note VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',          -- Admin-only notes
```

**Required indexes for system fields:**
```sql
KEY idx_state (state),
KEY idx_created_by (created_by),
KEY idx_access (access),
KEY idx_checked_out (checked_out),
KEY idx_language (language)
```

#### When to Include System Fields

| Table Type | System Fields Required | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Core entity tables** (user-managed CRUD) | Full set: state, ordering, access, created, created_by, modified, modified_by, checked_out, checked_out_time | Items, Categories, Customers, Orders, Invoices |
| **Secondary entity tables** (admin-managed) | Minimum: state, created, created_by, modified, modified_by | Addresses, Contacts, Tax Rates, Pricing Rules |
| **Link/join tables** (cross-references) | NOT required — keep minimal | item_tag_map, category_item, user_role |
| **System/log tables** (auto-generated) | Only created (timestamp) | Audit logs, Stock movements, Payment transactions |

#### Reference: Complete Core Table Template
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `#__example_items` (
    `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `asset_id` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    `title` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    `alias` VARCHAR(400) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    -- ... entity-specific fields here ...
    `state` TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    `ordering` INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    `access` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    `created` DATETIME NOT NULL,
    `created_by` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    `modified` DATETIME,
    `modified_by` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    `checked_out` INT UNSIGNED,
    `checked_out_time` DATETIME,
    `publish_up` DATETIME,
    `publish_down` DATETIME,
    `language` CHAR(7) NOT NULL DEFAULT '*',
    `note` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
    KEY `idx_state` (`state`),
    KEY `idx_created_by` (`created_by`),
    KEY `idx_access` (`access`),
    KEY `idx_checked_out` (`checked_out`),
    KEY `idx_language` (`language`),
    KEY `idx_alias` (`alias`(191))
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```


#### Hierarchical/Nested Tables (Parent-Child Relationships)

Tables with a `parent_id` column (adjacency list pattern) MUST also include **nested set columns** to enable efficient tree ordering and depth display in admin list views:

```sql
-- Required nested set fields (add after entity-specific fields, before Joomla system fields)
`level` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,    -- Depth in tree (0=root, 1=child, 2=grandchild)
`lft` INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,               -- Left boundary of nested set range
`rgt` INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,               -- Right boundary of nested set range
```

**Required index:**
```sql
KEY `idx_lft` (`lft`)
```

**Implementation requirements:**
- A `rebuildNestedSet()` method in the entity's **Service class** walks the adjacency list (`parent_id`) and computes `lft`, `rgt`, and `level` for every row
- The entity's **AdminModel** (`save()`) must call `rebuildNestedSet()` after every save so tree values stay current
- The entity's **ListModel** must default to `ORDER BY a.lft ASC` (set in both `populateState()` and the `getListQuery()` fallback)
- The entity's **ListModel** must include `level`, `lft` in both the SELECT column list and the `filter_fields` array
- The **list view template** renders indentation with: `<?php echo str_repeat('<span class="gi">&mdash;</span>', (int) $item->level); ?>`
- The **edit form** parent field must use `type="sql"` (not `type="list"`) to dynamically populate from the database

### Popups and Modals
- **Always use Joomla's `<joomla-dialog>` web component** — never use Bootstrap modals directly
- Reference: https://manual.joomla.org/docs/4.4/general-concepts/javascript/js-library/joomla-dialog/
- Load via Web Asset Manager: `$wa->useScript('joomla.dialog-autocreate');`
- Trigger with the `data-joomla-dialog` attribute on buttons/links:
  ```html
  <button type="button"
          data-joomla-dialog='{"popupType": "inline", "src": "#myTemplateId", "textHeader": "Dialog Title", "width": "500px", "height": "fit-content"}'>
      Open Dialog
  </button>
  ```
- Place dialog content in a `<template id="myTemplateId">` element — the web component clones it into the dialog body when opened
- Supports four popup types: `inline`, `iframe`, `image`, `ajax`
- For toolbar popups, use `$toolbar->popupButton()` with `->popupType('inline')` pointing to a `<template>` element
- Bootstrap modals (`data-bs-toggle="modal"`, `bootstrap.modal` script) are **deprecated** in Joomla 5 and must not be used

### View HtmlView Preferences
- Use the direct model call pattern, not deprecated `$this->get()` magic method
- **Toolbar setup**: Use `$toolbar = $this->getDocument()->getToolbar()` to get the Toolbar object, then call instance methods (`$toolbar->addNew()`, `$toolbar->save()`, etc.). Do NOT use `ToolbarHelper::` static button methods (e.g. `ToolbarHelper::addNew()`, `ToolbarHelper::save()`) — they are deprecated since Joomla 5.0.
- **Page title**: Use `ToolbarHelper::title()` for setting the page title and icon — this specific static method remains the standard approach as it sets both the toolbar title element and the browser page title.
- **Edit/Form views MUST load the form validator** via Web Asset Manager: `$this->document->getWebAssetManager()->useScript('form.validate');`
- Place the `useScript` call in `display()` after `addToolbar()` and before `parent::display($tpl)`
- Without this, the `form-validate` CSS class on the `<form>` element causes a JS error: `document.formvalidator is undefined`

### Filter Form XML Preferences
- **Do NOT include a `fullordering` field** in filter XML files — users sort via clickable column headings (`HTMLHelper::_('searchtools.sort', ...)`)
- The `<fields name="list">` section should only contain the `limit` (limitbox) field
- Filter dropdowns go in `<fields name="filter">`

### Rendering the List Filter Bar (searchtools)
- Render the search/filter toolbar with `LayoutHelper::render('joomla.searchtools.default', ['view' => $this])` — **NOT** `HTMLHelper::_('searchtools.default', ...)`.
- There is **no** `searchtools.default` HTMLHelper method: `Joomla\CMS\HTML\Helpers\SearchTools` exposes only `form()` and `sort()`, so `HTMLHelper::_('searchtools.default', ...)` throws `500 searchtools::default not found`. This is a common miscopy — the sort links are HTMLHelper calls, but the filter bar is a layout render.
- `LayoutHelper::render` requires `use Joomla\CMS\Layout\LayoutHelper;` in the template — omitting it fails with `Class "LayoutHelper" not found`.
- Column-header sort links remain `HTMLHelper::_('searchtools.sort', $titleKey, $orderColumn, $listDirn, $listOrder)` — that method does exist.
- The view must expose `filterForm`, `activeFilters`, and `state` (set from the model in `display()`); the layout reads them.

### Date Display — Use Joomla's Format Strings

Never echo a raw date column into a template. A database value is ISO (`2026-06-24`); what the
user should see is their site language's and profile's format. Route every displayed date through
`HTMLHelper` with a language-defined format string.

| Column type | Format string | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| SQL `DATE` | `DATE_FORMAT_LC4` | Calendar days — invoice dates, due dates, raised dates |
| SQL `DATETIME` | `DATE_FORMAT_LC6` | Instants — `created`, `modified`, `checked_out_time` |

```php
<td><?php echo $item->date_raised > 0
    ? HTMLHelper::_('date', $item->date_raised, Text::_('DATE_FORMAT_LC4'))
    : '-'; ?></td>
```

- **The empty guard is mandatory, not defensive style.** `HTMLHelper::_('date', ...)` defaults its
  input to `'now'`, so a NULL or empty column renders as **today's date** — a wrong value that
  looks entirely plausible and will not be spotted in review. `> 0` covers `null`, `''` and `0`.
  Fall back to `'-'`, matching `com_content`'s article list.
- Requires `use Joomla\CMS\HTML\HTMLHelper;` and `use Joomla\CMS\Language\Text;` in the template.
- Do **not** wrap the result in `$this->escape()`. Core does not: the output is a formatted date
  assembled from a language string, not user input.
- **API, CSV and export output is exempt.** Machine-readable payloads keep the raw ISO value.
  Localising them breaks consumer parsing and string sorting.

#### Record Forms — `translateformat="true"` on Calendar Fields

A `calendar` field in a record form has its own format, independent of the display helpers above.
Without `translateformat` it falls back to a hardcoded format and ignores the site language
entirely. With it, `CalendarField` resolves the format from language strings, choosing which pair
by `showtime`:

| `showtime` | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `"true"` | `DATE_FORMAT_CALENDAR_DATETIME` + `DATE_FORMAT_FILTER_DATETIME` |
| absent / `"false"` | `DATE_FORMAT_CALENDAR_DATE` + `DATE_FORMAT_FILTER_DATE` |

```xml
<field
    name="created"
    type="calendar"
    label="COM_EXAMPLE_FIELD_CREATED_LABEL"
    translateformat="true"
    showtime="true"
    filter="user_utc"
/>
```

- `filter="user_utc"` converts the submitted value from the user's timezone to UTC for storage.
  Include it on `DATETIME` columns; omit it on `DATE` columns, which carry no time to convert.
- Omit `showtime` for date-only columns, or the field offers a time picker for a column that
  cannot store one.
- Note these are `DATE_FORMAT_CALENDAR_*` strings, **not** LC4/LC6. LC4/LC6 are for display via
  `HTMLHelper`; the calendar field has its own set. Do not mix them up.

### Model Error Surfacing
- All ListModel and AdminModel subclasses MUST use the `DebugErrorAwareTrait`
- The trait overrides `setError()` to enqueue errors as warnings when `JDEBUG` is active
- The trait file exists in each component's `Model` namespace (same namespace, no import needed)
- Add `use DebugErrorAwareTrait;` as the first statement inside the class body
- BaseDatabaseModel subclasses (DataModels, DashboardModel) do NOT need the trait

### Sync Save Errors MUST Carry the Offending Record

Any save loop that reports its errors to com_synclog (via `EventbusService::amendLastRun()`) MUST
annotate each error with the record that failed. A bare `$table->getError()` is not diagnosable
after the fact.

**Why.** Drivers name the *column* but never the *row*:

> `Out of range value for column 'unit_cost' at row 1`

"Row 1" is the row within that single-row statement, not a position in the import — it is always 1
and always useless. By the time the message reaches com_synclog the run is over and the remote
payload is gone, so there is nothing left to work back from. Reproducing means re-running the whole
pull and hoping the same record comes back.

```php
// WRONG — names a column, identifies no record
$errors[] = $table->getError();

// WRONG — identifies the record but not the value that broke it
$errors[] = 'Item ' . $record->remote_record_id . ': ' . $table->getError();

// CORRECT — error, record identity, offending value, then the payload
$errors[] = $this->describeSaveError((string) $table->getError(), $record, $table_name);
```

**Reference implementation.** Add this once per component and call it from every save loop:

```php

Yielding:

```
Out of range value for column 'unit_cost' at row 1 [#__purchase_orders_line remote_record_id=1042PO12345 unit_cost=123456.78] {"remote_record_id":"1042PO12345",…}
```

**Rules.**
- **Where it lives**: the component's model `LocalTraits` when more than one class runs a save loop;
  on the model class itself when there is only one. Do not duplicate it per model.
- **Always cap the payload.** Error lists are capped at ten, so ten uncapped records would overflow
  com_synclog's storage. 1024 chars per record is the default.
- **State the named column's value before the payload**, never only inside it — the cap must not be
  able to remove the one value being complained about.
- **Cast the table's error**: `(string) $table->getError()` — `getError()` returns `false` when
  nothing was set, and the parameter is typed `string`.
- Keep any existing entity label (`'Item'`, `'Stock request'`) by passing it as `$label`; it becomes
  the first context field rather than a prefix.

### DataModel Pattern
- DataModels extend `BaseDatabaseModel`, named `{Entity}DataModel.php`
- DataModels are the **sole database access layer** for Service classes
- Service classes MUST NOT access the database directly — all data via DataModels
- DataModels use Table classes internally for CUD operations (bind/check/store/delete)
- Documented exceptions for bulk/atomic operations stay as direct SQL in DataModels
- DataModels are registered in `services/provider.php` via `MVCFactoryInterface::createModel()`

### Single Point of Authorisation
- Every component that serves more than one context (admin, API, CLI, plugins) MUST centralise **all** access-control decisions in one `Administrator\Service\AuthorisationService`. Do NOT scatter `$user->authorise()` calls across controllers, models, views, and API endpoints — that is how admin and API rules silently drift apart.
- The AuthorisationService is the **one Service that injects no DataModel/DatabaseInterface** — it performs no data access; permission decisions go through Joomla's ACL engine (`User::authorise()`). Register it as a bare `new AuthorisationService()`.
- Provide, for each enforced action, both a `can*()`/`authorise*()` bool method (for views to show/hide UI) and an `assert*()` twin that throws `NotAllowed` (for controllers/API to enforce as a 403).
- Implement owner cascades (`edit`/`edit.own`, `delete`/`delete.own`) once, taking the row's `created_by`; never re-implement them per context.
- Full pattern and reference implementation: `includes/joomla-authorisation-service-pattern.md`.
